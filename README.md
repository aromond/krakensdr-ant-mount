# KrakenSDR Antenna Mount
This is an SVG file for use with a cnc to cut out an antenna mount with predefined spacing for the krakenrf antennas. You may need to adjust the circle size tolerances based on your machine and bit etc, measure your bases of your antenna mounts to be sure, they may not all be exactly the same so you may need to adjust accordingly.

The rectangle inside the circles is meant to inset a piece of 3/4" wide x 3/16" thick steel stock available at most big box stores in the hardware aisle. This gives something for the magmounts to stick to. 

I used 3/4" plywood and was able to have enough depth to inset both the antenna base and the strip of steel.

I cut the circles to a depth of .2" and the rectangle for the strip of steel to .4" deep. As always I recommend you measure and adjust your toolpaths accordingly when setting it up for your machine.
